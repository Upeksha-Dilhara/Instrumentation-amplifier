# Instrumentation-amplifier for thermocouple 

An Instrumentation Amplifier, often abbreviated as In-Amp, is a specialized operational amplifier (op-amp) configuration designed for precision signal conditioning in various measurement and sensing applications. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource to help you understand, design, and implement instrumentation amplifiers in your projects.

## What you can find

Here, you will find valuable information, code examples, and documentation related to instrumentation amplifiers, including theory, design considerations, and practical usage. Whether you're an electronics enthusiast, a student, or an engineer working on instrumentation projects, this repository aims to provide you with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively utilize instrumentation amplifiers in your circuits.

We  are supposed to design an instrument amplifier for thermocouple. This is a group project with Nimesh Kavinda, Kavindu Shehan and myself.
