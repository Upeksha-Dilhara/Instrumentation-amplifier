# Instrumentation Amplifier for Thermocouple

This repository contains the design and implementation of an instrumentation amplifier tailored for thermocouple applications. The project was developed as part of the **EN3533 - Electronic Instrumentation** course at the **University of Moratuwa**. 

The goal of this project is to design an accurate and reliable instrumentation amplifier (IN-AMP) to amplify small voltage signals generated by thermocouples, ensuring precise temperature measurement. 
The amplifier is optimized to reject noise and maintain signal integrity in various industrial and scientific applications.

## Key Features
<p align="justify"> This project focuses on the amplification of weak thermoelectric signals generated by K-type thermocouples. The instrumentation amplifier design ensures effective noise rejection through a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). It incorporates high input impedance, which allows for accurate readings without causing loading on the signal source. The printed circuit board (PCB) is optimized to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) and features precise signal routing. Additionally, the design includes a built-in cold-junction compensation mechanism for accurate temperature measurements. </p>


## Introduction
<p align="justify">Thermocouples are temperature sensors that operate based on the Seebeck effect, which generates a proportional voltage when there is a temperature difference between two dissimilar metals. K-type thermocouples, which are widely used in this project, are recognized for their wide temperature range (0°C to 1300°C), rugged design, and near-linear output voltage. To amplify the weak voltage signals generated by these thermocouples, instrumentation amplifiers (IN-AMPs) are used. These specialized amplifiers excel at amplifying small signals with high accuracy, rejecting noise and interference, and maintaining signal integrity through high input impedance and low output impedance. In thermocouple applications, where signals are often weak and susceptible to noise, an IN-AMP ensures reliable and precise amplification.</p>

## Design Process
### Schematic Design
<p align="justify">The schematic design involves several key components, including a thermocouple connector with ground shielding, the AD8495 instrumentation amplifier, and filtering components such as resistors and capacitors for noise rejection. Decoupling capacitors are placed near the power supply pins to ensure stable operation. Differential inputs are routed with equal PCB trace lengths for signal integrity, while noise filtering is achieved using carefully chosen RC networks. </p>

- Differential filter cutoff frequency: \( f_{\text{DIFF}} = \frac{1}{2 \pi R (2C_D + C_C)} \)
- Common-mode filter cutoff frequency: \( f_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C_C} \)

### PCB Design
<p align="justify">The PCB design employs a two-layer board measuring 22mm by 33mm. The top layer is allocated for power lines with a width of 20 mil and signal tracks with a width of 10 mil, while the bottom layer serves as a ground plane to minimize EMI. Components are strategically positioned close to the thermocouple connections to ensure accurate cold-junction compensation. Differential pair routing is utilized for positive and negative input signals, and the design was verified using Altium's design rule checker. The PCBs were manufactured by JLCPCB.</p>
